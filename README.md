# FE5214 - Quantitative Investing

This repository contains all assignments and the group project submitted for **FE5214 Quantitative Investing**, a course in the Master of Science in Financial Engineering program at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

## ðŸ“š Course Overview

The course focuses on data-driven approaches to systematic investing. Topics include:
- Factor-based investing (e.g., Fama-French models)
- Portfolio construction and optimization
- Backtesting and performance evaluation
- Machine learning applications in finance

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- Each assignment is organized in its own folder, containing questions, code, data (if applicable), and documentation or reports.
- /Project: Group project on ML-based portfolio construction using Fama-French factors


## ðŸ§  Group Project  
**Title**: *Can Traditional Factors Like Fama-French Power Modern Machine Learning Portfolio Design?*  
**Submitted**: April 2025  
**Course**: FE5214 Quantitative Investing  
**Instructor**: Prof. Chen Kan & Ding Li

This project explores whether traditional factor models, particularly the Fama-French framework, can be enhanced using machine learning for improved equity portfolio construction. It involves:
- Predicting monthly returns using models like SVR, Lasso, and XGBoost
- Modeling volatilities via EGARCH(1,1)
- Clustering stocks into risk-return profiles (KMeans, Agglomerative, Grid-based)
- Portfolio construction via top-N selection and Sharpe ratio optimization

Despite no major improvements in forecast accuracy over OLS, the clustering and optimization pipeline was effective in producing competitive Sharpe ratios, occasionally outperforming the S&P 500 benchmark.
